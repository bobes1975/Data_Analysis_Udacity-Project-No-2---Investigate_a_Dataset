# Data Analysis Udacity - Project No 2 - Investigate_a_Dataset
This Project is part of Data Analyst Nanodegree Program, Lesson: Introduction to Data Analysis.

For this project the provided IMDb data set was used. This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (IMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

The Movie Database (TMDb) is a community built movie and TV database. Every piece of data has been added by our amazing community dating back to 2008. TMDb's strong international focus and breadth of data is largely unmatched.

My goal is analyse budget, revenue, vote_average and the relationship between these values of the provided IMDb dataset.
